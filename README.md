# Image to Speech Converter

## About 

This project is my pure interest in making something that could be a real product.

This application uses Google's OCR Tesseract for text extraction and then converts it to speech with Microsoft Edge's TTS service wrapped in a python library edge-tts.

So far I have not implemented any proprietary AI (as it is mostly impossible for accuracy), however, I might want to shift my attention towards this at some point.
